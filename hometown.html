              If you think about one famous city in Indonesia, what comes to
              your mind first? I bet you think about Bali, right? Well, here I
              would like to tell you about the capital city of Indonesia, which
              called DKI Jakarta (Special Capital Region of Jakarta). Jakarta is
              the economic, cultural and political centre of Indonesia.
              Furthermore, Jakarta's business and employment opportunities,
              along with its ability to offer a potentially higher standard of
              living compared to other parts of the country, have attracted
              migrants from across the Indonesian archipelago, making it a
              melting pot of numerous cultures.
            </p>
